- Joining multiple segments into one file with a simple batch script.
- Compressing video files with a built-in encoder or using an external codec of your choice.
- Supporting DirectX 11 games and applications.
- Removing the watermark and the 30-second limit on video recording.
- Unlocking the full potential of your hardware by bypassing any artificial limitations imposed by the game or the driver.

- Faster loading and initialization time.
- Lower CPU and memory usage.
- Fewer crashes and errors.
- Better compatibility with various games and applications.
- No spyware, malware, or viruses.

## Comparison with Official Fraps
 
The official Fraps is a paid software that costs $37 for a lifetime license. It has two versions: a trial version that has limited functionality and a watermark on the video, and a full version that has all the features but requires activation with a serial key.
 
The official Fraps website claims that it is the only legitimate source of Fraps, and that any other versions are illegal and may contain harmful software. It also warns that using cracked or hacked versions of Fraps may result in legal action or damage to your system.
 
However, some users argue that Fraps is overpriced and outdated, and that there are better alternatives available for free or cheaper. They also claim that Fraps has not been updated since February 2013, and that it has many bugs and compatibility issues with newer games and operating systems.
 
Therefore, some users prefer to use Fraps 3.2.2 Build 11496 Retail-[HB] full version instead of the official Fraps, as they believe it offers more features, better performance, and no risk of malware or legal trouble.
