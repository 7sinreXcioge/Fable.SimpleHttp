# How to Reset Waste Ink Counter on Canon Printers Using Service Mode Tools Version 1.050.exe
  
If you have a Canon printer that shows an error message like "5B00" or "Ink absorber full", you may need to reset the waste ink counter using a service mode tool. The waste ink counter is a feature that prevents the printer from overflowing the ink absorber pads inside the printer. However, sometimes the counter may reach its limit before the pads are actually full, and you may want to reset it to continue printing.

One of the service mode tools that can help you reset the waste ink counter is Service Mode Tools Version 1.050.exe. This is a software that can communicate with your printer when it is in service mode, and send commands to reset the counter. However, this tool is not intended for end users, and Canon does not provide a download link for it. You will have to find it on the web from a reliable source[^1^].
  
Before you use the service mode tool, you need to enter service mode on your printer. Service mode is a special mode that allows you to perform maintenance operations on your printer. To enter service mode, follow these steps:
  
1. Turn off your printer.
2. While pressing the Stop button/sensor, press and hold the ON button. (DO NOT release the buttons.)
3. When the Power LED lights in green, while holding the ON button, release the Stop button. (DO NOT release the ON button.)
4. While holding the ON button, press the Stop button 5 times, and release the ON button. (Each time the Stop button is pressed, the Alarm and Power LEDs light alternately, Alarm in orange and Power in green.)
5. When the Power LED lights in green, the printer is ready for service mode operation (nothing is displayed on the LCD).

If this method does not work, you may try a different number of pressing the Stop button in step 4, such as 2 times[^2^]. Note that some of the newer Canon printers may not be able to enter service mode by any known methods[^2^].
  
Once you have entered service mode on your printer, you can run the service mode tool on your computer. Make sure your printer is connected to your computer via USB cable. Then, follow these steps:

1. Double-click on Service Mode Tools Version 1.050.exe to launch it.
2. Select your printer model from the drop-down menu.
3. Select "Main" under "Clear Ink Counter".
4. Select "Set" under "Ink Absorber Counter".
5. Click on "EEPROM" to save the changes.
6. Click on "Exit" to close the tool.

Your printer should now be reset and ready to print again. However, keep in mind that resetting the waste ink counter does not clean or replace the ink absorber pads. If they are actually full or near full, you may experience ink leakage or poor print quality. In that case, you should contact a Canon service agent to replace them[^3^].
