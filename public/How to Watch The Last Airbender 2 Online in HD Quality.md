If you are a fan of the animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender, you might be wondering when the sequel film The Last Airbender 2 will be released. The first film, directed by M.

However, many people are still curious about the fate of Aang, Katara, Sokka and the rest of the characters in the second installment of the live-action adaptation.

Unfortunately, there is no official confirmation on whether The Last Airbender 2 will ever be made or not. Shyamalan has expressed interest in continuing the story, but he also faced a lot of backlash from the fans for changing some aspects of the original series.
